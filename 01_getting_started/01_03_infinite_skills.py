If I had infinite skills I would try to make three different things
The first thing is a chat bot with 0 restrictions, and I would want
to see how far it would go.
Secondly I would make hacks/scripts for videogames to see how far I
could also take them, whether its inventing new cheats or making old
ones more powerful.
Finally I would want to see if I could make a program powerful enough
to generate its own scam/spam mail and see what kind of info it could
gather.
Overall if I had infinite skills I would try to push the very limits of
python and mainly try to undo any damage I would cause after.
